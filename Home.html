  <h4> About Me </h4>
  <p> I am Serena Munro, a firstyear student at Keene State College. I am <br>
 currently majoring in Film Production. <br>
I've lived in New Hampshire my whole life, growing up in two homes due to <br>
my parents' divorce. I have a twin sister, Miah, and a brother, Aiden, who <br>
is two years younger than me. <br>
I have been lucky enough to grow up in a very loving family, who I will <br>
continue to stay connected with throughout and after college. <br>
Personality wise, I am an introvert and I tend to not socialize as easily <br>
as other people. During my time at college, my goal is to go out of my <br>
comfort zone, and meet new people. <br>
I have also always been an adventurous person, who loves to be outside. </p>
